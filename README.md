# sProcure - Hyperledger Buisness Network

## Description
Every organization has some procurement process, ex.  the government uses the Central Public Procurement Portal for publishing tenders. Whole Procedure is full of loopholes and any tampering in the process is not verifiable.
sProcure will address the problems of lack of transparency, and data tempering in the process of procurement.
It is HyperLedger blockchain-based solution that guarantees immutability, verifiability, accountability, and transparency. No person can tamper the original document without accountability and every change that will be made during the whole process will be verifiable by the auditors. Data privacy is another issue that sProcure handles by setting appropriate privileges for all participants using Hyperledger ACL.

## System Architecture

Here we implemented sProcure for specific scenario of Defense deals. This can be generalised for other organisations as well.

### Participants
